### The task

The task was to build a website using agile methods, more specifically Scrum. The project aimed to get to know the working method, its activities and artefacts. <br>


### Our application

Our application is called "Agili". It is a website promoting us as a digital agency. The user can read about our skills and core values, locate us and use a form to contact each one of us. The user can also create an account, and log in. In further development the idea is to customize the logged in users view - that different price information indicates depending on the customer's historical cases with the agency.  <br> <br>

To run the application please follow these steps: <br>

1. `cd src` <br>
2. `npm i` <br>
3. `npm start`

Open another terminal and type: <br>

1. `cd server` <br>
2. `npm i` <br>
3. `npm start` <br> <br>
